  - Start at folder **VOS_Update_Frontend**
  - Extract: **icu4c-64_2-Ubuntu18.04-x64.tgz** 
    then we have **icu** folder
```sh
$ tar xvzf icu4c-64_2-Ubuntu18.04-x64.tgz
```
- Copy all folders in **icu/usr/local** to replace same-name-folders in **VOS_Update_Frontend**
    (OVERWRITE ALL FOLDERS: bin, include, lib, sbin, share)
```
   
$ rm -rf lib
$ cp -r -p icu/usr/local/* .
```

$ cd src

$ ./main
# See result
$ cat output.txt
```
